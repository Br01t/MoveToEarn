# 🌍 ZoneRun Protocol
### Decentralized Move-to-Earn Strategy Game

**ZoneRun** is a gamified fitness application where physical activity translates into digital territorial control. By syncing GPS data (GPX files) from real-world runs, players move across a hexagonal world map, minting new zones, conquering territories from other players, and earning tokens.

## 🏃‍♂️ The Concept

ZoneRun combines **Fitness Tracking** with **4X Strategy** (Explore, Expand, Exploit, Exterminate).

*   **Move:** Run, Jog, or Walk in the real world.
*   **Sync:** Upload your `.GPX` activity file. The **Anti-Fraud Oracle** validates speed, elevation, and time.
*   **Conquer:** Your physical route maps to digital Hex Zones.
    *   **Mint:** If the zone is empty, pay `RUN` to mint it.
    *   **Conquer:** If owned by another, beat their distance record to seize control.
    *   **Reinforce:** Run in your own zones to increase their Defense Level and Yield.

## 💎 Tokenomics

The economy is driven by a dual-token system designed to balance inflation and scarcity.

### ⚡ RUN (Utility Token)
*   **Type:** Inflationary / Uncapped.
*   **Source:** Generated by running (1km ≈ 10 RUN).
*   **Utility:** Used for operational costs: Minting Zones, buying Items (Shields, Boosts), and challenging other players.
*   **Burn Mechanism:** Weekly protocol burns remove RUN from circulation to stabilize value.

### 👑 GOV (Governance Token)
*   **Type:** Deflationary / Hard Cap (50M).
*   **Source:** Strategic achievements: Minting new land, conquering enemies, completing Missions, and Leaderboard Airdrops.
*   **Utility:** Prestige ranking, unlocking Premium features, and purchasing exclusive cosmetic Badges.

## 🎮 Core Mechanics

### 1. Hexagonal World Map
The world is divided into a hexagonal grid. New zones are generated procedurally based on real-world GPS coordinates, clustering by country (e.g., IT, US, UK).

### 2. King of the Hill (Conquest)
Ownership isn't permanent. To keep a zone, you must defend it.
*   **Attack:** A challenger must run MORE kilometers in that specific zone than the current owner's record.
*   **Defense:** Owners can use **Shields** (24h protection) or simply run more to raise the bar.

### 3. Mission & Badge System
*   **100+ Unique Missions:** Ranging from "First 5k" to "Midnight Runner".
*   **Rarity Tiers:** Common, Rare, Epic, Legendary.
*   **Dynamic Progress:** Bars update in real-time based on your stats.

### 4. Anti-Cheat System
The `RunAnalysis` engine parses raw XML/GPX data to detect:
*   **Teleportation:** Impossible distance jumps.
*   **Speeding:** Avg speed > 25km/h or spikes > 50km/h (Vehicle detection).
*   **Duplicate Uploads:** Prevents re-uploading the same file ID/timestamp.
